Practice pull requests with me!
Using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRLGobWwA3Y, you can use this repository to practice pull requests. Edit my "About-Atlas" file with whatever you'd like! (After editing a file in VIM, press esc to return to the command line, then use the command :wq to save changes and exit.) (I guess you could create a new file too, if you want.) Go ahead and do a pull request here! I'm new to this, so I don't know if I'll be able to approve every request though. Thank you!
